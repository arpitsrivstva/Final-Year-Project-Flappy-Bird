            <h4 class="content" style="text-align: center;">* To avoid them at the best, you have to aim for the middle of those blocks and then do not click for uplifting if you are in the middle of those blocks.</h4>
            <h4 class="content" style="text-align: center;">* To score more, you have to take the lights to sustain the brightness and that's why you need to take the lights consistently but avoid the ones which are attached to the blocks because those are traps! You can try them if you are experienced enough in the game.</h4>
            <h4 class="content" style="text-align: center;">* Secret Tip: There is not only the left click but sometimes the right clicks are very useful. Use them on a sudden basis to pass through the blocks and unclick them as soon as you get across those to sustain the points or lights.</h4>
